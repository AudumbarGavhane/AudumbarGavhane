# 👋 Hi, I’m @AudumbarGavhane

- 👀 I’m interested in learning the latest technologies like **Spring Boot**, **React**, **.NET Core**, and **Python**.
- 🌱 Currently leveling up my **Java + Spring Boot** skills as I transition from a **testing** background to a **full-time development** role.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world projects and contribute to meaningful open-source repositories.
- 📫 You can reach me at: **audumbargavhane2@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but you can call me **Nandu** or **Audi** – my nicknames!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a **Mechanical Engineer** who loves writing clean code more than fixing machines.

> 💬 I believe learning never stops — and building real software is the best way to grow.
